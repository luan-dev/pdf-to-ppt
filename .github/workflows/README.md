## QuickStart Guide

Just create `.yml` files inside this directory

## Testing

GitHub Actions requires Git triggers to run. However, these can take time to queue and process.

You can run them locally using [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act)

Simply install it and run `act push` to test the example script
